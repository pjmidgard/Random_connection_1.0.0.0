Algorithm Random_connection:
Add one 0 or 1 on the start.
if 0 two different information 4 bits with between and then change to the same second bits after two the same information 4 bits two times and take 160b to 159b and between 0-7 or not comress 1 Equal between number or else to 161b.
When we extract for 0 add 0 to between bits and delete first zero or for 1 delete it on the start.
