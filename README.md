Random_connection_1.0.0.0

Algorithm Random_connection:
Add one 0 or 1 on the start.
if 0 two different information 4 bits with between and then change to the same second bits after two the same information 4 bits two times and take 160b to 159b and between 0-7 or not comress 1 Equal between number or else to 161b.
When we extract for 0 add 0 to between bits and delete first zero or for 1 delete it on the start. Reverse and opposite or equal.
It compress space between 2 nibbles two times in 160 bits block 0-7, equal or opposite and reverse it's look like this when not equal ...xxxx0001, ...xxxxxxxx0000, ...xxxxxxxxxxxx0011... 0110 and opposite way second step like xxxx0000, ...xxxx0000, xxxxxxxx0001... 1111
