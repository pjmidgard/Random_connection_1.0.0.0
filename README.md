Algorithm Random_connection:
Add one 0 or 1 on the start.
if 0 two different information 4 bits with between and then change to the same second bits after two the same information 4 bits two times and take 160b to 159b and between 0-7 or not comress 1 Equal between number or else to 161b.
When we extract for 0 add 0 to between bits and delete first zero or for 1 delete it on the start. Reverse on the end, x[4:5] equal or opposite and by this forumula (((space_between1//4)-(space_between2//4))-1)//divide divide by 1 or 2.
